A higher-order function in Python is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments and/or returns a function as its result. In other words, it treats functions as first-class citizens, allowing you to manipulate functions just like any other data type.

Higher-order functions are a fundamental concept in functional programming and can be used to achieve elegant and powerful abstractions in your code. They enable you to create more modular, reusable, and flexible code.

Here are some examples of higher-order functions in Python:
